# Jupyter Notebooks

The .ipynb file for the jupyter notebook is provided. You may download this and run it yourself. Due to limitations on data sharing in the Twitter API, I cannot provide the hydrated tweet data for you. The notebook contains information on hydrating the tweets yourself.

A markdown version of the notebook is available in the `analysis` subfolder.
